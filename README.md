# Pure Functional Games

![](./files/img2.png)

This project involves designing and implementing a variation on a classically inspired game using pure functions and combinators. Pure functions will be used to allow players to alter the state of the game in order achieve a specified objective, and combinators will be studied as their properties may be useful to extend the depth and strategy of the game.

Classical card games and board games often involve a combination of random elements and also a way for players to influence their performance by employing strategy. This project will mimic those characteristics and adjust them as necessary to create a robust, accessible, and deep game.

An example of a game based on pure functions may operate roughly as follows. Each player is assigned a 5 by 5 matrix of integers as their game board. In alternating rounds, players pick pure functions from a virtual deck in order to alter the state of their matrix. A player's goal is to create as many 10's as possible inside their matrix. When their are no more pure functions left in the deck the player with the most 10's in their matrix wins.

This project is part of the 2017 Wolfram Summer School.
